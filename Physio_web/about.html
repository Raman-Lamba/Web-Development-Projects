                <dt>Burpee</dt> 
               <dd>Burpees are a great full-body exercise to increase your strength and 
               endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend your 
               hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, and then 
               jump up from a squatted position. </dd> 
                
               <dt>Plank</dt> 
                <dd>Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push-up 
               position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position as long as you 
               can. </dd> 
                
               <dt>Mountain Climber</dt> 
               <dd>Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the 
               floor in a push-up position, bring one knee up to your chest, and then switch as 
               quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a mountain).</dd>
